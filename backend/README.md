# Backend PostgreSQL

The backend now requires a PostgreSQL server at runtime. For local development,
install/start PostgreSQL and set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` to the local
connection string in `.env.example`. Keep `PGSSL=false` for a local server.
The application does not connect to Supabase unless `DATABASE_URL` is explicitly
configured to point there. Never commit `.env` or share its connection string.

The payment provider is fixed to PayPal's Sandbox API. Create a Sandbox REST
app in the PayPal Developer Dashboard and put its Sandbox client ID and secret
in `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` in `backend/.env`. Never put
the secret in frontend variables or source files. The public client ID is
served to Checkout by the backend. Test payments require a Sandbox buyer
account; no real charge is made.
The PayPal order includes the saved product names, variants, quantities, prices,
discount and shipping breakdown; the browser never supplies the payment amount
or item details.

For a new, empty database, execute `database/Estructura.sql` and then
`database/Datos.sql` from the repository root. **Estructura.sql drops and
recreates the schema; never run it against a database containing data you need.**
For an existing database created from the previous schema, apply the numbered
scripts `database/migrations/007_paypal.sql` and
`database/migrations/008_paypal_sandbox.sql` instead of rerunning the
destructive schema setup.

The backend seeds/updates the two demo accounts at startup. Registered users,
hashed sessions, orders, payment references, variant stock, support tickets and
events are stored in PostgreSQL. A startup error is reported if the connection
is missing, the schema is not installed, or the ten catalog products are not
seeded.

After a Sandbox capture, the backend posts the paid order to `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`
so n8n can send the confirmation and tracking email. If that variable is
omitted, Nodemailer falls back to an Ethereal test inbox, logs its preview URL,
and does not deliver real email.
